# Photogur 
------

This is a project completed during my Bootcamp Course at General Assembly, Summer 2019


## How it works: 

You can perform C.R.U.D operations on photos you upload. 
Only those who have an account can create posts, edit and comment on theirs (as well as others). 

Uploads happen with _image links_ opposed to uploading images from your local comuputer. 

If you do not have an image link on hand, you can use [this one](https://i.picsum.photos/id/123/600/400.jpg)to generate a stock photo. 

    _NB: To change the stock image, simply change the id number (the three digit number after '/id/'). For instance, our link above has an ID of 123, try changing it to 456 and see what is generated!_
